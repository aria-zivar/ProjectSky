# PROJECT SKY
## Your one-stop-shop for all your Pokemon Scarlet and Violet modding needs (mostly (kinda))

## HOW TO USE:
1. Open Sky.exe.
2. If it is the first time you're launching, make sure to select your output directory.
3. Choose your desired editor.
4. Edit things to your heart's content.
5. Back out of the editor with the back button (VERY IMPORTANT, WON'T SAVE IF YOU CLICK THE X BUTTON)
6. Your exported zip file ready for use in Trinity Mod Loader will be inside your output folder you set in step 2!

## WHAT THIS TOOL CAN DO:
1. Edit Pokemon base stats, EV yields, XP growth rate, abilities, typing, gender ratios, held items, and whether it's in the game or not (don't do that last one if you don't know what you're doing)
2. Edit Pokemon evolutions
3. Edit Pokemon learnsets

## COMING SOON:
1. Trainer editor
2. Randomiser

# REPORT ALL BUGS ENCOUNTERED AND FEATURE SUGGESTIONS IN THE ISSUES SECTION OF THE PROJECTSKY GITHUB

## CURRENTLY KNOWN ISSUES:
1. Edited TMs don't show up if you load the Pokemon editor for the same Pokemon after closing it. It saves fine, though. A little annoying, I know, but I'm working on a fix.

# Author's Note: Inherent moves will show up as level 253 in the editor. Don't worry about that.
